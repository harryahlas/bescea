To clear it up for the new guys: raw tracks (.WAV, .AIFF, .MIDI files, etc) are NOT ""stems."" A ""stem"" is a mixdown of an instrument group, sometimes sent to a mastering studio instead of a complete stereo mixdown. So, for example, a mastering engineer may receive a ""drum stem,"" ""gutair stem,"" and ""vocal stem."" The drum stem would contain a mixdown of the overheads, snare, kick, etc. The guitar stem would contain both left and right guitars. The vocal stem would have all of the vocal parts. You get the point. We know what you mean, but you are using the wrong terminology, and it makes you look like newbies."

I have some questions that need to be clarified. First of all i will start with my gear:1.guitar->fireface 800 (instr channel)->Cubase5->Revalver mkiii-> C4->Paragraphic eq (8band) My first question is, i have read in this great forum that metal guitars must quad tracked. So if i use impulses in my revalver cab do i have to use the same impulse for the four guitars or do i have to use a different impulse for every guitar. Am asking this cause i bought redwirez mesa RectifierV30s impulses and it has impulses of the same mic from different positions, so do i have to combine em for example (100%left no1 impulse 70%left no 2 impulse 70%right no3 and 100%right no4)? My second is if i buy a preamp probably an (engl or peavey 6505) and plug it into my fireface 800 using impulses will i see a tragic improvement on my recordins? cause as i can see the main character of the sound is affected by the impulse that is loaded and not so by the preamp. Here is a take i made using the same impulse(redwirez): http://www.lightningmp3.com/live/file.php?id=20309 Is that guitar sound ok for making a boomy mix or need improvements. I really need your pro advices. Thank you in advance"

2018,Test your ears - WAV vs various MP3,http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/threads/test-your-ears-wav-vs-various-mp3.652428,"I struggle to hear the difference between WAV's and Mp3's, so I'm just making this to see how many of you truly can hear the difference and who's just claiming they can. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/324723/Raw Audio.rar (give it 5 mins to upload) Minute long segment, some loud bits, some vocals (forgot this song didn't have real vocals) and some quiet bits. All I did was rip the WAV from the CD, convert it into 3 separate mp3's, import all 4 into Sonar, realign them (mp3 conversion added a bit of delay) and exported them individually as 16bit 44.1khz stereo wav's with no dithering.

4661,Need vocals and feedback,http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/threads/need-vocals-and-feedback.506883,"A couple of months ago I recorded a song for a friend and since then a couple of different vocalists have fallen through on laying down vocals. I've seen a few guys post here asking if anyone would like to give it a try for the fun of it and thought I'd give it a shot. Vocal style would probably be somewhere along the lines of similar to Black Dahlia Murder. Metalcore vocals could work. Screaming is good, but not looking for straight up death metal. There's a quote from a movie at the beginning (typical) that lyrics could be based off, but doesn't really matter. Anyway, I'd appreciate it if some kind folks would check the song out whether they're interested in vox or not and give me some feedback. This is the first song I've mixed in Reaper since 3.0 came out and I've decided to make the switch. And yes I know, it's far from perfect. You can get an mp3 of the song here. Tempo is 126 or 252.

Real bass is aweome, but it could be quite some work and effort getting that sorted and right compared to just using the VSTi bass(es). Would anyone be up for that to begin with?

Whomever's drums sound the most realistic and I end up using I will paypal you 10 bucks to grab a pale ale or 2 on me. I am hoping to get both a stereo wav file of the final product and the midi file (in case I need to go in and tweak it later and hopefully to learn from).

4599,Help with live sequenced keyboards!!,http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/threads/help-with-live-sequenced-keyboards.509234,"In my Doom/Death band we use sequenced keyboards since our keyboardist left us. We haven't done it live yet but we have a 90% confirmed show in a couple months and will do it this way. Now in rehearsals it all comes out well except for one issue. I can hear the click track coming out pretty low in the monitors, but before we start playing it can be heard, after we start playing it's totally muted out. Problem is we are going to play in a very small place (very cool actually), and if it can be heard through the PA even at that low level the audience will be hearing the initial click track beats and it will TOTALLY ruin the show IMO. I do it this way: I have the sequenced tracks as mp3s in my Iphone, with the click track panned totally on one side and the keys on the other. I connect the iphone to two separate tracks in my small mixer (using a rca cable with plus changing it to 1/4"" plugs) the way the pics show, with the cable that goes from ""Stereo Out L"" being the PA send and the mono out being the headphones for the drummer with click track and keys mixed in: It has always worked great this way (and I have tried MANY ways of connecting everything), except for that IMPORTANT issue. I checked the mp3 waves and the left side is totally blank when there is only click track going on, So it doesn't seem to be an issue with the mp3 track, seems to be some of the right signal is leaking into the left signal somehow. Any ideas?? would be greatly appreciated"

The CD sounds very claustrophobic, smushed, and hyped and the vinyl has an amazing sense of space (stereo image is massive and defined and there's a good sense of depth.) It also actually sounds pretty dry compared to the CD. The vocals are all really dry and the room verb on the drums is pretty subdued compared to the cd. And the really really hyped high end is also not so hyped anymore, really smooth. So yeah, the best rock mix EVARRR just got better.

3353,Wow...Pro Mastering FTW!! (+ comparison clips),http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/threads/wow-pro-mastering-ftw-comparison-clips.557011,"I just got the final masters for an album I recorded and mixed and I'm impressed! I used to think my ""mastered"" (i.e. maximized) mixes sound pretty good but now I can't even stand listening to them, the properly mastered ones are that better, yet in the same time, they don't sound drastically different (they are not supposed to). Some observations The mastered version is more open and balanced, the dynamics are somehow more alive, the vocals sound real and full, the guitars have more definition and are also sound fuller, the low end is cleaner and rounder. In comparison my maximized mix is slightly scooped and harsh, muddy and thubby, the dynamics are more static and suppressed, the vocals are less natural because of their scooped quality, the guitars and cymbals are thinner and more harsh. Comparison Clips Song 7 (double bass + tamboura and bagpipes = ) Mix Final Master Mix + Maximizer LOUD Master Song 8 (lighter and more acoustic) Final Master Mix + Maximizer Loudness We decided to go for the less loud option so that we can avoid audible clipping, to maintain higher sonic fidelity and keep things punchy. The band didn't mind and neither did the mastering engineer (Nathan James from The Vault, http://www.vaultmastering.com/ ). He was actually fond of the idea...I wonder if he was surprised that someone wants his masters less loud for a change I must admit I was tempted to go for the loud master, since as you can hear the loudness makes you perceive it as being really big, mean and powerful but ultimately I think I made the right decision. Gear Used Analog EQ - Sontec 432B/C9 Analog Compression: Manley Variable Mu Compressor Tube Line Amplifier: Custom DA/AD provided by Mytek and Prism (AD-2) A splash of Digital MS EQ : Weiss EQ1 MkII Leveling by Oxford and Sequoia. Eye Candy Summary This is the first time someone else masters my mixes and I hope it won't be the last. When the band told me they planning on having it mastered elsewhere I was initially worried that my mixes will be ruined or that they'll spend a load of money to get the same thing I would have done. Thankfully, even if this scenario was possible, the result is actually awesome. I recommend all of you to give pro mastering a go, especially if you're not mixing in a well-tuned and treated room, and most of us aren't. If you're the next Andy Sneap, or indeed Mr. Sneap himself, you can pass Thanks I must thank the forum for providing me with the possibility to have a sort of mastering contest, thanks to which I found Nathan, whom I should thank, too. He sent me some really great sounding demos and his approach is a very rare combination of professionalism and friendliness Feedback ...is welcome I'd be happy to know what you think about the recordings/mixes/masters/etc. I'm not involved in the music itself but I could mention your thoughts to the band and by the way, their whole album is going to be available for download in a day or two so I'll give you a link in case someone likes their stuff.

IMO, the only conversion occurs at the tracking stage, when you are capturing the source (if using mics/triggers of course), and in this case it'd be analog to digital.

Had been looking around the forum for quite some time decided it was time to join! **Edit: Oops, think I might have posted this in the wrong sub-forum... sorry. Probably should have been under Production tips...*** Advance apology for the long post... sorry, I just want to be as detailed in my description as possible... Anyway, I'm mixing drums for my good friend's band and I'm having some issues. The sound they are aiming for is similar to The Red Chord, Carnifex, etc - modern death/progressive metal. I'm recording in a finished basement - wood floors, carpet under the drums, drop ceiling (about 7'6"" high), and I've controlled most reflections around the room with Audimute acoustic blankets and some rockwool acoustic panels. Not the best sounding room, but it's fairly dry and free of reflections. I'm doing my best to do without drum replacement. I really want to try my best to stay away from sampling the snare. The kick is the only thing I'm sampling, as I had tracked the drums with a mic and a trigger track and I like how it's sounding. I'm using samples of the actual kick from the kit. I recorded with a spaced pair overheads (audix adx51's), a mono room mic (akg c2000b), beta 57 snare top, i5 bottom, 57 hi hat mic and akg c1000s ride, audix i5/d2/d4 on toms, and d6 on kick. I've done my best to get phasing between mics all aligned. My mic placements were all textbook and proper. The snare and overheads are probably my biggest issues right now. The problem comes in when I am working with the snare sound. I tuned these drums meticulously - a big pearl vinnie paul sig snare - medium-tight tension - sounds REAL fat and big. I have a pretty good amount of hi hat and other drum bleed in the top snare, even though I used a hypercardiod mic and positioned it as best as I could out of the pickup zone of the hi hat. When I gate/expand the snare, I can get fairly pleasing results - not too choppy, but enough to tame the bleed and leave the sustain of the drum. Occasionally some hi hat and cymbals peek through when they're in unison with the snare, but there's nothing that can really be done about that. When I compress the snare (quite highly, as I need the consistent dynamics for an unsampled snare), I get really unpleasant bleed coming through the gate. It pops through and the only way to get rid of it is to have such a fast closing gate that I lose all tone from the drum and am left with just the transient attack. Plus, using the Dominion transient shaping plugin, I tend to add so much attack that I lose all the body of the drum. Adding any more sustain brings out more bleed. Also, when I go to add some sparkle and clarity to the snare and overheads (eq, harmonic enhancers, etc), it becomes a muddy mess. I'll side chain the snare to the overheads, but it compresses the overheads around the snare hits too much and leaves everything sounding muddy and undefined. I'll use a reference track just so I don't get lost within my own mix, but I can't get anywhere even close to the sparkle and shine of most recordings. Nothing fits together and it's frustrating the hell out of me! I'm gonna do my best to get my best mix down uploaded to here soon, possibly tomorrow, so that it's easier to hear what I'm dealing with. These modern, fat, huge drum sounds seem so unachievable. Something like the sound from The Contortionist () would be amazing... As far as I can tell, the snare seems almost 100% natural. I love this drum sound. I realize that my sound will be individual and replicating a sound is not realistic and not exactly desirable. But I like to base sounds off of something to begin with. Any response would be amazing. I've read through many posts here and I feel like it would be great to get some customized feedback, and not just re-reading the sticky post of the drum recording guide... Thanks!"

This could be a long post so try and bare with me guys My band is getting ready to record our second full length album. Our first album was recorded in a fairly nice studio(The Recording House Studio) here in Canada where we are from, and it cost $20,000 cdn to record/press. We are not signed to any label or management at this point. I should give a little background info: A couple months after we released the album, we signed with Intromental Management. Thus far we have been pretty happy with them as they have lined us up on a fairly big North American tour next month. They also announced in their press release about us, that our next album would be our first release on a Record Label. So right now, we have to record another album, and at the managements request, we take 4 or 5 of the best songs from our first album, rerecord them and record another 4 or 5 new ones to make this new album(they didn't want to use our first album which we spent so much money on lol, to shop around to labels, because they didn't think it was strong enough). Considering the amount of money we spent for the first album, there was no way we could afford to go to a studio again. So we have decided to record ourselves. And here lies the dilemma. I was wondering what you guys would do if you were in this situation. None of us really have any recording experience, I mean the odd thing here and there but nothing that makes me confident about this process, considering this album could be getting released through a label. Granted, we have some pretty decent equipment. We started doing some research and bought a custom computer, we have a nice mackie board etc. But other than that..... We have decided to reamp our guitars so I've gotten a quote from OZ, and from hearing his stuff I know the guitars will at least sound good lol. But the drums, we don't have a nice room to record them in so we are programming the drums, vocals we will be going to studio for. Bass will also be reamped. Our management has referred a couple people to mix it that most of their bands use: Jailhouse Studios / Tommy Hansen Jacob Hansen (denmark) Spacelab (germany) Thin Ice Studios (uk) If anyone has read this far, which I doubt lol, but if you have I need some advice on how you would go about this. Has anyone here had experience of working with a mixing engineer in a different Country? How do these things work? Anyway, any opinions would be appreciated, thanks guys. Ken"

I've been observing the ultimate metal forums for quite a while now.. Some of you guys are gods and I just can't thank all of you enough.. All the free software amps that have been coming out.. HOLY S@%!!!!! Ive been playing guitar for 16 years now. I play in a band that has 6505+ and a 5150 on rythym and the sound you get from these free software amps is so ridiculously close... 8505, that 5150 sounding one are like Deja-Vu. and without a doubt that v30 thing.. That thing is my go-to for chuggy rythym tracks, only question is which impulse.. I dl'd one from somewhere around here.. Really similar to my lead players 4x12 Mesa (1600$) sound but a bit less throaty which I prefer (Less eq = less headaches) (also free).. I honestly run my line 6 pod xt live (500 bucks when I bought it) into my computer in complete bypass mode and use the software I found on this site (free.. ) Also just the information in the stickys made my band sound better over the course of a week.. I really appreciate your guys effort. Anyway. More to the point. Ive been a vocalist for 6-7 years, and I was lucky enough about 4-5 years ago to stumble upon a Urel LA-4 (sexy black death box) and I went thru a differant couple mic preamps thru the years.. Turns out I kinda like cheaper ones. I dont completely squish my vox or distort them.. Just a lil drive, little cut.. In love with that sound.. Its been my sound.. Plus makes the highs in pigsqeels screeee-eee-eee-eam.. So my LA-4 got jacked.. Its gone.. and I have alot of things to spend 700+ dollars on before a new one.. Is there any software compressor/limiters that are similar.. I miss my sound.. dbx is poop. Also any pro tips on mic pres/compressors/anything whatsoever = Also.. If anyone who writes these beautiful guitar amp software is out there listening and isn't too busy writing these brilliant programs for the greater good of music and GUITARISTS everywhere.. Us VOCALISTS need a free plug too! Something that emulates a good metal voiced compressor/limiter and possibly a usable vocal drive/distort.. I was in love with my LA-4 sound.. Thatd be something good to emulate.. Not even sure what top of the line pre amps are.. Expecially for maxing/od.

Well, it is related in such way that I'm here as a member (obviously) and drums were recorded in Daunt's Drop-Hammer studio and guitars were reamped there by him. I recorded guitars, bass, synths and vocals. The main idea while recording was to do it the ""old-school"" way. So for example there is no quantizising done on the drums, all the other instruments are recorded in as long as possible parts, etc... After everything was done the stuff was sent to Dan Swano for mixing and mastering. The album is done now. Yesterday we went to take some photos for promotional usage and for the cover artwork. It was a huge blizzard here yesterday so we got some cool snowy photos. Hah! Here are some videos. Drums: Vocals: Bass: Guitars: First teaser: Currently http://www.death-illustrated.net/ is working on the artwork and we are negotiating a deal with record label(s).

Midi / editing / etc is like writing a partition). Do any of you process sometimes a bit this way to record some external source to your project ?

Sometimes my ideas may change the song a lot, like if I suggest to change the structure of the song. The problem is that a lot of bands seem close-minded about their music, and don't really care about my ideas. I think it could be because I don't have a lot of experience and a big list of bands I produced, the same bands would probably accept advice from someone like Sneap but not from someone with little experience like me. So, if you fucking KNOW the song would be better without repeating this riff 10 times or without this stupid riff, how would you convince the band that you're right?

We only have a ""band space"" which is our rehearsal room that we have worked on (proofing and treatment) to work on our music and record (in the same place because of budget restrictions). Now that iam thinking about it even if i wanted to bore you that's about it haha. I have a bit of trouble understanding something that maybe you could shed some light on: How long of a delay in signal are we talking about before we have phase cancellation issues? Although i realise that the signal can never be completely aligned because of different wave lengths, i often read about stereo splitting with say a 5-7ms delay for live performances. This is important to me as i am the only guitarist in the band and it will get me closer to double tracking or well the punch you get from two guitarists playing the same riff, (though the imperfect tuning of the guitar has to do with the thickness as well) at least theoretically since i havent tried it yet. I bought a tc 1210 i might use to try that out. (cannot yet as i am still waiting for some gear to complete my rig) Why dont you get phase issues when you do that? is it because the delay in time is not enough to create a problem? That is why i am asking how long the signal has to travel compared to a ""source"" before you get that hollow sound if i can describe it that way. I may not be asking the right questions to understand that stuff; if this is the case please clarify that for me. I have other questions but ill leave you alone for now haha. Anyways, thanks to all of you for this wondeful forum. A real gold mine. Later! Sary"

The problem is that the house was isolated because of the big amount of snow of the past weeks. I went there to pick some cables and my marshall cab in january and after 2 days the snow started...so who knows since when the house is in those conditions. All my equipment (minus the profire2626, a couple of mics and the cabs) is still there, in some boxes over a carpet...on the opposite side of the radiator. The only hope I have is that the carpet maybe have stopped the water. If the boxes have been reached by the water maybe all the mics have been into a lot of humidity for a lot of time so lot of hoxid inside.

Ellefson replaces James LoMenzo, who had been in the band since 2006. The reunion coincides with the 20th anniversary of Megadeth's classic Rust In Peace album, which the band will be playing in its entirety on a tour that begins March first. Frontman Dave Mustaine comments on Ellefson's return: ""This shows the power of brotherly love and forgiveness. ""David Ellefson belongs in Megadeth. Next we are going to show you the power of getting your asses kicked...HARD!"" David Ellefson concurs: ""This is a huge moment for all of us, band and fans alike. It is a great celebration of the music from one of the biggest landmark albums of our career."" I recently interviewed LoMenzo, who is a really nice guy and excellent bass player. He's served the band well, but Ellefson is an original member, and it's cool he's coming back. This Megadeth lineup, which also includes guitarist Chris Broderick and drummer Shawn Drover, has the potential to be the strongest incarnation of the band since the early '90s. No real comment, bassists suck."

I know a lot of the songs are b-sides, but it sounds like they didn't even try to make them sound good. The only song I like on this album is ""New World Order"", and I don't even like this version... I much prefer the version that came with the Japanese release of Hidden Treasures (which I believe is close to (if not the same) version that's on the Youthanasia remaster reissue). Aside from the weak songwriting, the production just seems lazy. For example, if you listen to the new version of ""New World Order"" specifically, you can here several spots in the guitars and vocals that are clearly punch-ins and copy/paste edits. And Dave's vocals are MUCH louder on this album than on any other album I believe... which makes his straining voice that much more apparent. Everything just sounds muddy and wishy washy together... again, just overall a lazy mix. I even like Risk and The World Needs A Hero more than this release. I really wish Andy would have been tapped for this album too. Oh well. What are your thoughts? Anyone else feel the same way?

It was absolutely amazing, it was my first experience with real high end gear, got to hear a API 2500 in action for the first time, it was amazing. Everything came out fantastically well and we had great fun making weird noises with every effects pedal we could get our hands on. Including an Eventide delay which was just great. Anyway pictures! (sorry for the cell phone quality) Gear More gear! And again Drums! Video! I'm currently uploading drum tracks for anyone who would like some practice, they came out great! Its probably going to take a while though, my net sucks."

Simply put, the album is good, but I only really listen to it because that bass tone makes me pop a woody a foot long. But who really cares, I can hardly tell what the fuck he's saying most of the time anyway. \m/"
1942,anyone else here use beatcraft for drums?,http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/threads/anyone-else-here-use-beatcraft-for-drums.656632,"because i do, and i wanna know what other people think of it, since im the only one i know of who uses it. personally for me, i find it a lot better than reaper's midi because each sample rings out beyond the next hit instead of choking when the next hit comes in, if that makes any sense at all (or maybe thats optional with reaper midi, havent looked much into it) but i do know that beatcraft absolutely SUCKS for tempo changes, which is anticipated to put a measure of silence between each tempo change. what i also dont like is that it doesnt offer room/ambience like other programs, so they dont tend to sound as real. also doesnt help that trying to humanize patterns really suck. anywho, my other main point of this thread is to see how i can emulate a room/OH with reaper. would it make sense to throw the drums and cymbals to seperate buses and throw some heavy reverb with little attack on them? ive been trying that lately with just the cymbals and its making the mix sound a little bigger. i know production is all about do what sounds best to the ear, but i wanna know if there are other ways to go about doing so that can render a better/more realistic result"

442,Weird chirping sound,http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/threads/weird-chirping-sound.760384,"Ok, my guitar is chirping way too much and it is really annoying cause I have to scoop the mids to get rid of the chirp on every single pick attack! I've got the guitar with steel strings installed, could they cause the trouble? Since steel offers more resistance than nickel, could that be the cause for chirp?"
