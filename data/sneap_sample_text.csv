2365,Just seeing if anybody has any tracks that they wouldnt mind me having a go at mixing? Just for personal use and practice I was hoping to do some post hardcore but anything would be great. Thanks in advance

1085,"I just got a new ""special"" Mesa Rectifier a day or two ago, and I want some DIs to play with to see if this thing is staying in the amp tower of power or not. Because of this, two people are getting free reamps First two people to get me some awesome sounding DIs with a backing track of a well played and edited song before 12:00 P.M. NOON EST on August 9th (today) get the reamps! Get on this fast, because I plan on taking most of the day off tomorrow, but my love for guitar tone cannot be fettered. I may accept submissions up 'till 12:00 or 1:00, GO GO GO! Post in this thread, AND PM me if possible. Cheers, Greg"
3959,"I didn't know weather to post this in the off topic because its a bit random, or in the main thread because I will probably post the finished product here to get your thoughts. But first a little back story. Some of you video game heads may know of the Overclocked Remix site. A site for people to upload remix or rearrangements of video games old and new. Such reworkings range from techno/electronic to orchestral and metal renditions. I settled that my first attempt at an rearrangement would be of Golgo 13's ""The Mafat Conspiracy"". Being a fan of the comics(manga) and enjoying the NES games, I thought it would be a great way to redo the main theme outside of its ""chiptune"" territory. Anywhos, my only delimma is that I'm torn on what ""style"" to do it in. Either a very modern John Powell like vibe with some synths, or a 60's/70's retro feel, or a subtle Trip Hop vibe to an avant-garde, out there feel. I'll put the poll up to get what you guys think and after a week I will go with the finished result. Oh, if your curious as to what the theme sounds like, you can just youtube ""Top Secret Mission"", or ""Mafat Conspiracy"" to hear it. After I get this one knocked out, I have plans to do some Castlevania Symphony of the Night."
3160,Is anyone comnig?
3929,Does anyone know if the guitars on the latest Arch Enemy dvd were reamped? And if so do you know what amps they used. I love the guitar tone on that performance.

1279,"My band's New Video - Song mastered by Jens Bogren. [ame=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frwqZts54-Y""]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frwqZts54-Y[/ame] Let me guide you through the process: Few weeks prior to the concert, we asked all our fans to filmed the show with their cellphones, cameras (regular or pro), in order to use some of their footage for our new video. After a few weeks, we received lots of great footage, our loyal fans, that we actually baptized as 'La Familia S.o.E.' did a spectacular job, they really captured the vibe and energy of our live performance and that's what really makes this video so special; since you can actually see the band through their eyes and emotions. We can't be more thankful to them. This is our best video so far, no doubt about it. Shows the band doing what they do best and in front of the most loyal fans around. ""This is how we live metal in Costa Rica. This is how we show the world what we are made of. We are ready to conquer the World."" ENJOY lads!"
1243,"Conduit Please check out my new project. A pre-production preview has just been released. All mixing was done by me. We are going to be releasing another new song very soon. After that we will be tracking vocals and then recording a debut, full-length album. Like this page if you would like to be updated on the progress. Thanks guys. Hope you dig it."
2527,Pretty cool. I have no clue how even someone would even do an animation like this. Anyone do stuff like this?
1970,"Lets say I'm solely the person who's tracking the singers vocals. We're tracking it line by line. It's my responsibility to make the decision if a take is good enough to keep or if we have to do it again until it gets right. The singer always asks me ""hey, your call, is it good enough?"" Then i'd either say ""let's do it again"" or ""yeah sounds good, let's try next liine"". Sometimes the singer and I would also reach the conclusion together wether a take was good enough or not. Most of the time i'd have to tell the singer if he was singing out of tune, how much, wich words etc and how we should try it differently. If we where dubbing the vocals i'd have to tell if it sounded tight enough and eventually what parts that we needed to redo to get it right. Does that make me a co-producer or am I still just an engineer."
2708,"Hey guys. Had some really nice drums to record this weekend. A Mapex Saturn kit. Was beautiful. Nice and sparkly with nice new heads. The kick drum had a mirror skin on the front... I loved it! We hired out a log cabin for the weekend to record the drums. It's going to be a bonus track on our new EP. The snare drum was an FVF Custom snare. It was 20ply maple sandwiching acrylic. Looked sort of like this but with offset lugs. Anyway, samples are here. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3526809/SAMPLES.zip There's 3 hard kick hits. The third one is the one I ended up using. Was miced with an Audix D6 right in the hole. There was a kick port thing on the hole which gave off a lot more beef from the kick. I had to get the mic in past it to get the attack I needed. There's 3 hard/medium/soft hits for the snare drum. It's just the dry drum. It was recorded with a Shure Beta 57 about 2 inches above the head pointing towards the middle of the drum. Hope somebody finds these useful"

3670,"What are your favorite songs that you use to compare your mixes to when your mixing and mastering and why? What is your favorite Sneap song and also what is your favorite non-Sneap song? I usually use 2 songs, to get in that ballpark... My go to sneap song is usually off ""Formation of Damnation"" by Testament. Usually it's Henchmen Ride or the Evil has Landed. The reason is I just love the drums on that album. The Guitar tone is there, to my ears everything is just so well balanced and tone wise it's there. My mixes don't sound like this, but certain aspects I like to compare my mixes to. Even the bass, while not loud, has just the right amount. Usual non-Sneap song is Inflikted by Cavalera Conspiracy. To me this is another incredible sounding mix that just has the right tone, and depth. The song has a nice 3 dimensional sound to it that is hard to beat. Nothing about that song sounds harsh to my ears. Your turn"
3969,just got it now first listen besides the mp3 leak. Tones sound fucking beautiful and have marshall written all over it. Steve Evetts (palendrome heh heh) has done it again and i'm pumped for his work on Dillinger Escape Plan's Option Paralysis
2167,"Hello. Here is the permalink to my introduction post in case you want to see some info. I was routed to this forum by a friend who convinced me that this is the best place to seek guidance in metal production. Info Naturally, I was seeking forum because I need help. Before that, though, I think it's important to provide few informations on the situation: I'm a self-taught producer and composer using software and generally don't know much about music theory, playing instruments or gear. I can, for example, listen and take down melodies on the keyboard with ease, say, but I have no clue what I'm doing. I've spent the past 10 years producing and composing orchestral and electronica music and although I'm good at it, I still do everything by feeling. it just happened that way and there's no turning back. So when you talk to me, it's best to pretend as if I'm mentally challenged. Since before summer of this year I finally started working on metal-type music, waiting for the right time, y'know, money, software, etc. The music of Rammstein, Ruoska and Eisbrecher is something I'll be aiming at, though other genres are not excluded. However, it's lame to start composing while with every new day my sound shifts to better, so I'm aiming to have an approximately-complete setup and then do a so-called demo album in the future. Problem I'm stuck. The production of this music is different and I'm not familiar with it. I'm learning on the way, but most of my work is method of mistakes. I need a guide because I don't know what to do to increase quality. I think I raped my production yesterday and destroyed even the possibly good sound I had. The software I'm using which is an electric guitar is Shreddage for rythm/powerlead and EEG Strawberry for everything else. We will focus on the Shreddage. The amps I'm using are Metal Amp Room, Revalver MKIII and Guitar Rig 4 (as well as TSE ENGL head freeware). The host is FL Studio and it's the only program that suits me. I was convinced that although I can't reach 100% exact sound, I can reach 85-92% of what I want and for that the MAR and especially Revalver should do the trick. If you know better, please suggest so. I will not be using real equpiment. This is the perfect sound I want to approach: . Alternatively, it's this: and the likes. Now, ignore bass-drums (bass is Pettin, drums are Addictive Drums), this is where I'm with my current setup (want Pirunkieli): This is revalvermkIII cabinet default x4 with TSE head and a bit of EQ (cut below 200, reduced mid): Riff Revalver MKIII+TSE Speedyshare This is Metal Amp Room: Riff Metal Amp Speedyshare This is Guitar Rig 4 Rammfire head+cabinet no control room: Riff GR4 Rammfire Speedyshare All three plays are on Shreddage with open sustains which means I'm layering notes to make a powerchord, although shreddage does have auto-powerchords which I generally don't like because it' lacks composing freedom. // So, the issues: The screeching, trashy sound, too much in front, too much extra noise, it kinda iron-screeches cccc when palm muting instead being soft, clean but strong, etc. Whenever I improve, I think fuck this is great this shit can't get better, then I listen a song next day and realize it's not good enough. Then I listen to Ruoska and realize it's not good at all. No clue what to do anymore (please don't say buy real equipment, that's not the point because I heard brilliant mixes based exclusively on software )."
3133,Have to say that I'm pretty impressed by the video. With labels trying to cut corners on everything this looks pretty good. To bad on this video the sound is clipping like a mofo.

4065,"hey there guys, I was just wondering how many of you have contracts for bands to sign before they record in your studio. I`m having trouble with a band that is frequently truant from scheduled recording sessions. Its holding me back because I have other deadlines to meet. I did get half of the payment upfront. but now I have done more work than they have paid me for and their truancy has pushed the project back so far that I wont have time to complete it (which means they dont pay me for the second half) So I`m telling them I am not continuing the project, nor am I booking anymore days for them in my studio. I have other bands coming in. So I will probably have to deal with them talking shit about my studio. In the future I am going to get bands to sign an agreement that they will attend all booked recording dates. failure to attend, without contacting me in advance to cancel, will result in me having the choice of not continue the recording session, and keeping a deposit that they will make prior to signing the agreement. does this sound fair to you guys? Anyone have experience with a similar situation? Does anyone else have bands sign a similar contract? thanks guys! edit: also, what would you think is fair? Should I give them all the raw tracks they recorded, minus my editing and reamping? or should I give them nothing?"

We can either keep it to the original *E i believe* or we can attempt to be a little more original with it, but then it's not REALLY a tribute IMO. My band will be playing a Holy Diver tribute at our next gig, and essentially I just transposed the song so that it could be played in Drop B etc kind of like killswitch, but with the original riffs/ notes etc. So that's an option/ But if you guys are happy, the original way seems fine to me and probably is the best to use. Thoughts?? Cheers, Chris"

The seller may seem legit cause he has 98% positive votes, but all positive votes are from really fucking cheap sells, and now after lots of cheap sells he comes with this 8100$ guitar... So I just wanted to warn everyone I could!"
1482,"I dont know if any of you have heard the NEW Deftones album its fucking great. Anyways the vibe/color of the album has ""a veritable myriad of visuals, sonic landscapes"" ""Chino is welcoming the world properly to outer space ""-reviews Chino said that when writing this album he had star wars in mind. Anyways what are some programs with synths that have this surreal sound/texture i fucking love it. Its soothing and beautiful. Please any plugin suggestions as well as any specific names of ambient synths would be great. thanks."
4262,"I thought I had a guitar stolen 2 years ago at a show I played in another town. I didn't even think of it being stolen or anything until a couple months later, because of all the gear we were moving at the time...I figured it got covered up somewhere. After a few months, I started wondering and began to contact the bands we played with, asking if they knew of it's whereabouts. None of them did. A couple of days ago, this guy from another town over hits me up on my myspace and says he has this guitar that he was pretty sure I could do justice for and wanted to trade me a motorcycle for it or something. He described it, and I was like ""wtf? That sounds like mine!"". So I conned him into telling me the s/n, since I still had the warranty card with the s/n on it: he told me. Sure enough, it was my axe. I was still under the impression it was stolen, so before I said anything else to him about it, I called the cops in the town where it went missing to file a report (which I didn't do at first because it was months before I figured it got jacked, and the police don't exactly have a good track record of finding stolen stuff, IMO). They called the PD where this dude lives...those guys called the dude up and said it was reported as stolen. He was like ""Oh shit, I didn't know! I'll just go bring it to him now!"". Come to find out, my axe sat in a venue in the town where the dude lives, which we played once, for over several months. This dude came in one day, after seeing it there over this period of time, and asked the bartender about it. BT said ""Its been here for months, nobody has come to look for it. I'll sell it to you for $150 just to get it out of here"". So he grabbed it...and held onto it for almost 2 years, as he is a lefty guitar player and it wasn't going to do him any good...he figured he'd get rid of it eventually. He saw me play a few times, and admired my playing, so he figured he'd offer it to me first. He didn't even know he was offering me my own guitar! So, he brought it back to me last night. It's obviously been fondled (missing a lockdown screw for the nut, the DiMarzio click-lock strap is missing the main part of it, a screw in the pickguard is missing), but I got it back. My 1991 Ibanez RG750BK, which I brought with me as a backup to a show and got left behind...is back. Now I'm only irritated as to why it got left behind. The one time we played there, I couldn't get the night off from work. They told me I could play the show but I had to come in when I was done. So literally after we stopped playing, I handed my gear off to my band and went to work 30 miles away. The dude who usually oversaw the equipment when I wasn't able to, who is no longer in the band anymore for reasons like this, tended to get a little off task whenever there was any offer of a party or whatever. I'm sure he was distracted for whatever reason and left it there. So yeah...theres my story."

3883,"This isn't a request for specific information, rather a suggestion that we pool all thoughts and ideas on guitar setups, including everything from string gauge, intonation tips, everything that you guys do to your guitars or hope the player has done to theirs that affects sound or tone before the sound leaves the guitar... (the reason i've suggested this is recently i've been listening to Arch Enemy's Rise of the Tyrant a lot more. Not an album that blew me away mix wise (Wages and Doomsday own) but when listening to some of the guitar parts, specifically the verse riffs for I will live again, I can't get over how the slides and chord changes sound so powerful yet so precise, the notes are so perfect, and i know playing guitar properly is the main factor, but i also know it helps if the guitar is setup properly.)"

I use the SM7B for cleans and screams, so obviously I am going to need a preamp with enough gain and a good enough sound for both. Do these preamps typically have a usb port or something to hook them up to the computer? Anyways, I'm looking for something below 200 bucks, and will probably go used. But recommend away! Don't need multiple channels, just going to be recording vocals at one time by itself. Thanks guys."

3148,"C'mon, don't tell me you didn't see it coming I just wanted to try to describe in words the sheer JOY I feel when I work with this platform above all others. Something as simple as going through some guide tracks and adding tempos, meters and markers is an absolute breeze. The workflow it provides you with can almost be called musical. Hell I was just jamming out to the tracks I was marking. I'm not even going to get into multi-track audio editing here because that would be a novel all on its own. Suffice to say that this DAW feels like an extension of myself whenever I use it. It is such a pleasure to jump to after being forced to mix in Cubase for a few days. It is leagues beyond in intuitiveness workflow, appearance, functionality, it's ridiculous. Sure it has it's pitfalls like... well, namely Digidesign - Being hardware exclusive, not supporting VST/AU and a few other things. Even with all those drawbacks it's still my platform of choice for editing and tracking whenever possible. The designers obviously consulted professional audio engineers, and didn't leave things to chance like many other DAW makers. The fact that you don't need to surf through endless sub-menus with stupidly verbose options that may as well find their way into a literary jerkoff contest is an absolute boon for someone looking for expediency. Anyway, this is a thread for PT users to share their thoughts about the platform. Likes and dislikes, and where we think Digi might take the platform in the future, given the impending obsolescence of TDM systems."
3878,"So I've been listening to Ignite's latest ""Our Darkest Days"" lately a lot and I'm beginning to think that he might be the guy to fill the huge shoes Jerry Finn (R.I.P.) left behind. Cameron also did mix Social Distortion's and Motorhead's latest, which both sound great. Especially ""Love, Sex And Rock'n'Roll""... I was so bummed out when I heard Jerry died, because he did the IMHO best sounding modern punk records of the nineties (Dookie,...And Out Come The Wolves, Enema Of The State etc.). And I've been finding some of Jerry's trademarks in Cameron's productions: very audible bass, GREAT vocal sounds, punchy and clear yet somehow raw guitars. Opinions?

3859,"guys, i just wanted to ask if we should have some rules for people looking for mixing engineers here on this forum ? (note : i dont know if thsi has been discussed and if i'm not aware of this, but nevertheless do i never see people post what they are willing to pay right off...) here are some thoughts on rules for ($$$ for mixing) : 1. i think that we need something like a minimum rate. i feel that most bands think we're just sitting there, loading our presets from our cracked software ,taking 1 hour to mix a full length sounding like randy staub... (( take a look at this video here : Mastering : The Movie )) i watched this, totally laughed my ass off... and then i realized : sadly, this is how bands approach my work. i want people to recognize that we are also artists in what we do, i'm not a plumber, i really put my heart into what i do... (if there is plumbers around here : no offense! i know there are plumbers who put their hearts into their work) 2. hard facts! maybe they should post some crucial facts about what is the band/label going to pay per song / per hour... (more than minimum wage is always welcome of course ;-): in the end hopefully people let quality decide, not who takes less money. (but maybe our different currencies might become a problem...) 3. only users with + 50 posts can ask for mixing this shows me, that these people are serious about what they do, that they know this forum, and appreciate our work here. i compare that to the nigeria connection on ebay. they have names like ""0454XXdksdj"" and have 0 transactions yet. then, they buy your stuff, ask you to send the stuff BEFORE you receive any money. they tell you they have currently no account, because they got divorced yesterday and also their dog got sick and so on ;-).... 4 . only short clips also i think we should only post something like a chorus (or maximum 30 seconds). people are expecting to upload a whole song and make us fully automate, sample replace, pocket, vocal tune etc. before ever getting payed. this secures us from people stealing full production ideas (harmonies, fx, climax in a mix) this way, the engineers abilities show through, also its way faster for people to listen through 20 >> 30 secs clips than 20 >> 3,5 minutes clips. and decide. final thoughts : these are just thoughts and maybe we can work on this, just to protect us all here from people abusing this forum and all the talent that is around here. i know this is all connected with problems . but hey : these are just some quick thoughts, and lets start a discussion about this."
42,"I suppose there must be more than one Skyclad fan out there. Is one of my favourite bands ever. ""Wayward Sons..."" and ""Irrational Anthems"" are in my opinion the best albums and ""Folkemon"" and ""Answer Machine"" the worst.

Is it true that Martin will leave music forever and ever?"
2949,"http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=140098 Wolf Hoffmann (guitar) and Peter Baltes (bass) of reformed German heavy metal legends ACCEPT were interviewed on Russia's Radio Rocks radio station on Friday, May 14 prior to the band's headlining show at B1 Maximum Club in Moscow. Watch the chat in two parts below. Also available is fan-filmed video footage of the concert. The new lineup of ACCEPT made its live debut last Saturday (May 8) at the 750-capacity Gramercy Theatre in New York City. ACCEPT's new studio album, ""Blood Of The Nations"", is scheduled for release in North America on September 14 via Nuclear Blast Records. The band's 15th LP was recorded at Backstage Studio in Derbyshire, England with acclaimed British producer and SABBAT guitarist Andy Sneap (MEGADETH, EXODUS, ARCH ENEMY, NEVERMORE). The CD which will mark the recording debut of the band's latest addition, vocalist Mark Tornillo (ex-TT QUICK) will contain around 14 tracks, including ""The Abyss"", ""Shades Of Death"", ""Teutonic Terror"", ""Blood Of The Nations"" and ""Pandemic"". Regarding Tornillo's addition to ACCEPT, Hoffmann previously said, ""It all happened in minutes. Peter and I were working on some tunes in a studio in New Jersey. Somebody suggested we give this guy Mark a call to see if he would join us on vocals. So when he arrived we started jamming on some old ACCEPT tunes just for fun. As soon as Mark started singing we looked at each other and realized the impossible just happened: we found a new voice for ACCEPT! The timing could not have been better! Now or never... We are re-energized and excited..."" TT QUICK was a popular club band during the 1980s in the New York and New Jersey area and was known for the guitar work of David Dipietro and the powerful vocals of Mark Tornillo. Dipietro's skills were especially singled out as he had given lessons to both Zakk Wylde of the OZZY OSBOURNE band and SKID ROW's Dave Sabo. TT QUICK disbanded and later reunited sporadically and released a few more albums, including a live CD from one of their reunion gigs (""Thrown Together Live"") and a studio effort, ""Ink"", which came out in 2000."

As it stands now I'm thinking I should just dump the audio files out of the my original mix session and import the new audio files to the region list and drop them into the pre-existing tracks.

I'm really new into the whole recording ""process"" and I'm doing it purely for my pleasure. I know that I have a lot to learn but hopefully by strolling in these fora I'll get there... Anyhoo, I like playing heavy/power stuff like Judas Priest, Iced Earth, Virgin Steele, Gamma Ray, Iron Savior... you get it. This setup, gives me a nice heavy dark sound, very suitable for rhythm. A lot Iced Earth-ish actually. This is a demo, you will hear the rhythm guitar sound at about 0.45... I have a Dean Vendetta 1.0, mahigany body, rosewood fretboard. But what about the other bands? How can I ""approach"" their sound? Iron Savior and Gamma Ray have a very crystal clear sound, but Virgin Steele have this ""crunch"" high gain (I guess) sound... If that is too complex to answer, maybe you could tell me the ""fundamental tips"" of the heavy/power guitar sound, I will then tweak the heck out the amps sims to get the sound I want. I'm in Eb tuning, don't know if it makes that of a difference... And a friend of mine will be installing the SH-4 JB SD on my bridge.

When replacing the system drive, is it possible to not go through all the freakin' install processes all over again? If I make a backup of the disk, put in a new disk and reload the backup on the new disk, plug the old one out and switch the cables to the new one... would that essentially capture my previous disk's OS/installed programs and put it on a new disk under a flawless operation?

3922,"Because I compose a lot of stuff myself, I tend to have a lot of ideas for songs of bands I record/mix. Sometimes my ideas may change the song a lot, like if I suggest to change the structure of the song. The problem is that a lot of bands seem close-minded about their music, and don't really care about my ideas. I think it could be because I don't have a lot of experience and a big list of bands I produced, the same bands would probably accept advice from someone like Sneap but not from someone with little experience like me. So, if you fucking KNOW the song would be better without repeating this riff 10 times or without this stupid riff, how would you convince the band that you're right? And do you normally care about their songs, or you just do your job? Max"

3450,"Hi Everyone, Im having a few issues with volume levels in my playback after recording a track in Reaper. Heres my setup: Micd Cab using an SM57 into my Presonus USB audio box direct into my computer. Im using the most current version of Reaper, ASIO drivers, etc. Details of the issue: Before recording, all levels are loud enough and balanced out nicely. It sounds great. But when Im done recording and I playback, the volume is really low. I tried using the master mixer to turn up the volume for the track, but it starts clipping and gets very crackly and distorted and starts jumping into the red. Is there something Im missing? I know its not the volume set on my headphones, computer, or audiobox. Because before I even record, my line-in is at the right volume level that I want and everything sounds great. Its just after I record that the playback volume is super low. Is there a setting in Reaper that I should try tweaking? I know this may be a simple fix; so if it is, I apologize in advance for being a complete nub. If this has been posted a thousand times, would you mind helping me find the page to solve this issue? Ive tried searching the site through google to find an answer, but most of the answers I find are irrelevant. Thanks, in advance, for any help."

3454,"So we start rhythm guitars on thursday, and a concern was raised about having one guitarist play the rhythms to all the songs, which is presumably normal. The notion popped up to have the ""other guy"" play the rhythms to the one song he wrote, to sort of include him more in the process (he's contributed riffs and leads to numerous other songs as well). I don't see this as a problem, as both guitarists have very similar rhythm styles, and neither is a sloppy player. The main guitarist though seems to be pulling the ""90% of tone is in the hands"" card and is afraid that that one song will sound noticably different from all the others if he doesn't play it. the same guitar and rig would be used. It is arguable which of the two guitarists plays tighter rhythms. I've worked with DI's from both of them. If it were all about tightness I would prefer to play rhythm guitar on all the songs I wrote, but seeing as I'm playing bass for the band and not guitar, I'm not gonna try to hog everything. Its already been discussed that if any body gets stuck on any rhythm parts on my songs I'll probably have to jump in on it anyway, thus defeating the whole ""hand tone"" argument. So I guess the question would be: Do you think it would be that big of a deal in the end to have the rhythm guitars for one song played by a different guitarist? I am of the opinion that there would be no discernable difference in the end, but I'd like to consider other opinions as well. Sorry if this should have been posted elsewhere. Didn't seem to fall into production tips, but still seemed a bit too ""production-esque"" for the off topic tavern."

I can't sing for toffee so I have to rely on others like Greg *Uladyne * However I have 2 songs that need a softer touch, a more clean/melodic style voice. This being the first of them, dispite the heavy track itself I dig the guy who tracked these 3 years ago's vocals, I like his mature tone. However he hadn't sang in 20 years so he didn't keep his tuning very well throughout the track. Alas! Its a good base for all the melodies to show somebody else for the re-recording. So if you think you or somebody you know could do this track justice please get in touch! This will be going on the finished EP if your voice suits! Ive chopped some parts of the track just to give you an idea of what im looking for...and yes its wayyy too loud and clipping to fuck but its all I have *I was a noob when I recorded this* so its just a reference. http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/451140/FID_Voxscout.mp3 Thanks guys!

4865,"Hey guys, I just had a quick question about cabling with guitar DIs. Specifically I am using the Behringer GI100. Normally I use them from a line out on the back of the amp. Well... not all amps have line outs. In this quote direct from their website it says the DI supports ""Direct connection of amplifier outputs with ratings of up to 3,000 Watts."" My question is, when doing that, and using a passthrough cable (running amp output->DI then DI->speaker cab), I would use a speaker cable, correct? I am using these in a live situation, not for studio work, and usually use them in combination with a mic, but I like the control I have over the tone when using a DI. Thanks in advance for your help."

3463,"============================== OK...before anyone says this is spam or this post does not belong here I feel that it does because Shane McFee (Kazrog) from the Andy Sneap fourms mixed and mastered CD as as well programmed the drums. This CD was recorded in the bedroom of my apartment...so a home (apartment) recording can be done well enough to get very good radio and video play. Thanks for all the hard work Shane!!! ============================== What up Death Metal Freaks? This coming Monday night (Tuesday Morning) Bloodsoaked's video for the song ""Rotting In Filth"" will be on MTV2's Headbangers Ball. The show will be airing in the middle of the night @ 3:00am Tuesday morning so set your DVR's and Tivo's to record this shit. This will be an edited (more MTV friendly) version of the video so this is the World Premier of the newly edited version. Many of you around the USA have already seen the un-edited version on your local Cable and Satellite companies on Havoc TV On-Demand, Fuse On-Demand as well as the DirecTV's Music Blocks. Keep your eyes open for it to re-appear again soon as well as Bloodsoaked's other two videos for ""Suicide"" and ""Unborn Horror"". This is a HUGE victory for Bloodsoaked to be on such a legendary show such as MTV's Headbangers Ball. Having watched almost every episode of Headbangers Ball since it premiered in 1987 this is a dream come true! Thank you to all the fans that have supported Bloodsoaked and continue to do so. Be on the look out for a new CD as well as a sick DVD sometime in late 2010. Below is the un-edited ""Rotting In Filth"" video, set your DVR's to check out the new edited video! Peter - Bloodsoaked"

The power tubes are RUBY 6L6GCM-STR and the preamp tubes are a mixture of SOVTEK 12AX7LPS and EH. Are those ""stock"" tubes are far was what peavey would typically use? Per serial num, head was made in 2005. Also, when looking at the BACK of the head does is go left to right V1 to V6? #2. The effects loop on this amp.. I have a G Major and already set it to CONSUMER but the loops just sounds.. fubar. Normal? #3. the MID knob on the lead channel. If I turn it ALL the way down the amp gets LOUDER. It's strange. Normal behavior? I dont think anything is wrong with the amp, just curious if other people who own the amp have this happen on theirs? Thank u in advance.. im running this into an oversized boogie recto slant cab with V30 and with pre on 4 and the eq dialed it is the perfect brutal tone. YOWZA!!"

I have clips to demonstrate. Clips (not the best but just want to get point): Clean DI track: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/728056/test/DI.wav DI with Lepou amp: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/728056/test/DI_AmpSim.wav Notice that towards the end(breakdowns) you hear that feedback when guitar stops playing. Amp miced: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/728056/test/Real_Amp.wav So yeah I know that feedback can easily be cut.. but why is that when i record the DI with no splitting to Real amp I dont get that(Feedback or Hum)? Em I even splitting the guitar right with the countryman? I know you guys might say Put the ground switch but that only makes it worse :Smug: BTW I read the Countryman Manual but didnt really understand the way they mention how to split guitar signal, anyone can clarify?"

174,"Hey guys, I've got a fun little project for you all! I'm currently in the MIXING process of a very diverse album, and I would like to honor you all with the opportunity to collaborate get your opinions heard on this album! The cool part about this album, is due to the diversity, I refuse to have a STATIC sounding record. Most albums I hear these days, have songs that sound completely identical to each other. I want to give these songs some creative room to breathe! This is where you come in, after I post a song, don't hold back, give me all it is that you would like changed about the song and I will go right ahead and give your idea a shot in the mix. After a few ideas have changed the sound of the mix, I'll post an updated version and we can continue from there. I will be posting a new song from the album as soon as we call the song we're currently working on finished. I will give UltimateMetal as a community credit on the release. There are a total of 8 songs on this record. We will go in order, first track to last. Lets start with one right now, shall we?! This first track is completely untouched when it comes to EQ. There's a bit of compression and delay, but that's about it. DropBox Whatcha thinkin'?"
2376,"So my band is working on our new record with Matt Hyde right now and I thought that I would try and learn some stuff and share it with you guys. I'm sure I won't be learning anything super top secret, but it's pretty cool to get to see the techniques that bigger names use compared to what I do when producing/engineering smaller bands. Thus far he has been extremely hands on. When working on harmonies and chord voicing he is grabbing guitars off the rack and experimenting side by side with us. He's been sliding parts around like crazy and really helping us make our songs what will hopefully be hits. Thus far what I've learned is that he mixes almost completely in the box and then sums his channels through a Chandler Limited Mini Rack Mixer. When tracking and mixing we've been monitoring through that chain. It's weird to hear the preproduction sessions that we did at my small studio run through his Apogee's to the Chandler, you can really hear the difference and the finished vibe to it. If only I had 6 grand to blow. Another thing that I felt was pretty interesting was that when discussing drum mic'ing he said he always starts with the overhead mic that will be closest to the floor tom. After that sounds good he goes to the floor tom mic, get's them in phase and then moves on to the rest of the kit. We haven't started drums but I thought this was an odd place to start. I guess I'll see this weekend where he goes from there. If you are unfamiliar with him, he did Hatebreed - Perseverance, Slayer - God Hates Us All, a bunch of stuff for Monster Magnet and Strung Out. From the looks of it his biggest record was Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt which he has a plaque that says 14 million records sold... fucking ridiculous. Recently he just produced/engineered/mixed the new Children of Bodom record as well as Terror's newest Keepers of the Faith. I guess what I'll do is try and keep updating this as we get going deeper into the record. I'm very stoked because we've never recorded with someone who has done so much. I'm excited to learn a shit load and hopefully produce our best record to date."
1055,"Hey, i am starting a project with a a band, its some kind of power metal, nightwish style. but i really find it hard to find a good guitar tone. the guitars in this style are quite in the back, and with lot of reverb. any tone i get (checked this forum for many samples) just get lost in the mix. it doesnt have enough mid grit and treble grit. i wondered if anyone has a raw guitar track in this style (Edguy, Nightwish, Within Temptetaion, what ever), so i can get some good refernce of this sound.

560,I have a band coming in the studio in a few weeks and theyre having a pretty big name engineer mix it. I feel like I should contact him to ask him if he wants anything specific and to let him know a little bit of how ill be tracking. I don't want to be a pain in the ass but I would like to make sure I get him everything that he would need. So for the guys who normally do tracking only do you typically contact the person mixing yourself and guys who mix only do you like when the tracking engineer contact you let you know a little bit about the gear that you used and ask you what you would like?

I enter the ""control room"" I shit you not, his studio only consists of a macbook and a firepod hooked up to a 60"" LG monitor. I really didn't know what to say. So I ask him about what gear and amps he has, he says ""Its all in here."" pointing at his macbook. Being polite and just probing for what this guy knows I ask him about if he has his eye on any outboard gear. He says ""Whats outboard gear? I dont understand what that is."" WTF...!!! This was going downhill fast. I ask him about his background if he plays music and he said he isn't a musician he just a computer guy that knows how to manipulate programs. So I asked him to show me his portfolio. He hands me a cd and says that this is a band that he payed to have a cd made at another facility before his opened, and is handing this out for promotion for his studio. When I was asking all of these questions to him he was starting to get irate. At this point I was wishing for Tad!!! He also said ""Yea Protools is a horrid user interface and that he had Cubase that came with his firepod but it isn't as intuitive or flexible as Garageband. Obviously this guy is fraudulent and this business wont hold up. This is a perfect case of why you can buy a computer and go to guitar center and by an interface. This does not constitute you being a studio. I am so floored. I fill sick now and need to puke. FFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU"

2920,"I. Introduction Hey guys, I'm happy to say that for the second time an album I've recorded and mixes has been mastered by the very talented and friendly mastering engineer Nathan James from The Vault Mastering Studios, New York. Some of you may remember the previous thread and since it got so much attention and great replies I decided to make this follow thread which I am hoping will be of benefit to both beginners and advanced mixing or mastering engineers. I shall start by providing samples of the material before and after mastering, as well as the maximized sample I sent to Nathan for Reference. I will then briefly share my opinion regarding the differences that can be heard. I'll ask a couple of questions related to those differences and the way they are achieved and Nathan will shed some light on the whole process as well as answer any, or at least some of the questions you'll add. I will edit this post whenever there's a new contribution. II. Clips Mix Sample mp3 | wav Reference Sample mp3 | wav Mastered Sample mp3 | wav My thoughts: On first listen I immediately noticed how much more alive and punchy the whole mix and especially the drums sound. It also felt as if it were more 3D as opposed to the relative flatness and stillness of the reference sample. Another important difference is that the vocals sound real and not like a recording. The low end in the mastered version is so much better in so many ways, too. The kick sounds quite powerful without being too intrusive and the bass is pretty solid. The brittle high-end of the reference sample gives way to one that's a lot smoother in the mastered sample. Overall, I'd say this is all that can be expected from an excellent master and any noticeable improvement would have to come from the previous stages (tracking, mixing, etc.) III. Info Photo of The Vault Mastering Studio IV. Q&A Q:I know with the right dynamics and eq you can make a mix sound punchy but how can you add this sense of extra depth and 3D sound? Usually you can't bring forward something that's not there so I assume these features of the recording exist but are somehow subdued. What parameters do you deal with to achieve this? A:I get asked this question often and my answer usually starts with the often-cliched ""Do no harm"" response. It's not news by any means, but every link in the chain has the potential to diminish that sense of spaciousness and detail that already exists in a mix. From a mastering perspective, that (along with having a monitoring setup that accurately reproduces those details and your adjustments) has to be the starting point. For well-mixed loud heavy guitar and drum based material, I'm almost always running my analog chain through a custom tube line amp stage which feeds my console. It sounds really great and can definitely give a mix breadth and smooth out some of the edges depending on how hard it's driven. This was a piece I had modified by Dave Smith over at Sony right before he passed away. There's a lot of love in that box so I suppose that would classify as a bit of a secret. That coupled with a little presence from the Avalon 2077 and some low sculpting from the Sontec....it just works for me. Q:I mentioned the punchy drums - did you use clipping or have you achieved this by carefully choosing compression settings? Is there some secret or is it a result of experimenting? Any tips? I'm very careful to avoid having any one piece do heavy lifting for any aspect of the process. So instead of leaning on one compressor for dynamic control, I might use 2 or more together (one to pass through for some color, another for added impact, perhaps another to bring a little more gel to the mix). I eq in the same manner....it's rare for me to apply more than 2.0 dB or so to any particular band on an eq. I'll usually divvy up those tasks if something needs a lot of work. My Prism AD-2 also has to keep things in check coming back in to digital land. Depending on the material, and the goals of the client, I might push into it a little bit as well, especially if there are heavy drum tracks involved. Generally speaking though, I'm not a fan of clipping. So when I can get away with it I'll avoid it. My Sequoia session template also loads up several bypassed peak limiting choices for me so it's very easy to sync them up and audition them to see which one (or combination) suits the end goal of the tune. Q: I notice the vocals in your masters always sound spot on (or at least as good as the recording allows). Do you just follow your gut, tweaking till it sounds right? Doesn't your frequency perception get skewed at some point and if yes how do you counter this? Thanks! I've been an instrumentalist for the bulk of my life so that's a nice compliment. Vocals are tricky for everyone involved. It really just comes down to listening and trusting my monitors and my ears. I know that's a non-specific answer but there really is no one way to go after them. Hopefully the vocals come in sounding well-balanced with the instrumentals, in which case it's merely a matter of preserving what the mix engineer laid out and making the critical decision of whether an improvement can and should be made. In the absence of that, sometimes more is needed to strike the right balance. It's usually just a little bit of EQ to make things sit right but there are also occasions when a good M/S eq and a good M/S compressor can help in a way that they can't in the stereo domain. Both of my analog compressors are hooked up to run in M/S if needed. My M/S eq work is always surgical, and for that the Weiss EQ1-MKII is my go to. As far as keeping things fresh, I take a break after every 3 or 4 songs and these days I generally don't do any eq work past 8:00PM. That keeps my brain and my ears fresh and ready for the next session in the morning. =) There's probably a bit too much coffee and too little sunlight thrown in there but whaddayagonnado? Q. Regarding your EQ usage, how do you divide the tasks and do you use two or more instances or units of the same EQ or is it crucial that they are different in character? The main factor for me is that when I EQ, I have to have confidence that any adjustments I make are enhancing the listening experience. However that's attained entirely depends on the material and how a project is sitting in my room. It's nice to have a few different EQ flavors to choose from but it's not necessary to make a good sounding master. One nice sounding EQ and one complimenting compressor can go a long way. Q. If the mix you've received is far from ideal and aspects of it call for some serious intervention, how do you make the tough decision what to change and what's better left unchanged? Especially since in such mixes fixing one thing ruins another. Example: The overheads are too bright but the vocals are almost dull, you try an M/S EQ but every time the hi-hat is played there's way too much bleed on the snare track. Lots and lots of automation? My first concern in the case of something being far from ideal would be to communicate my findings with the mixing engineer and make sure that he/she and I are on the same page. If the changes required are better suited to be adjusted at the mix stage (and the mixing engineer is available and open to that idea) then I can avoid having to make those compromises which will ultimately lead to a better end product. Also, the last thing you want to do is upset an artistic decision that was made by the producer/engineer/artist during mixing. This is why communication during the mastering process is so important.... In those cases where a mix recall is impossible and the engineer's response is ""Do what you can"", things can get quite surgical. I don't use a lot of automation in the traditional sense. I'm more inclined to work in sections and edit segments together. I might make those changes on the analog side and splice together, or split up the file into segments in Sequoia and make the changes I need there. Totally depends on what the best tool is for the job. There will always be compromises when making even moderate changes to a stereo mix. One helpful thing that many of my clients will do is book an hour or so for me to listen through their mixes when they think they are 90-95% complete. If I can spot a problem area and an adjustment can be made to the mix before the actual mastering session begins, then the end result will always benefit from that. Q. Do you usually use any kind of stereo widener/stereo enhancer? Most of the width of a mix will come during the actual mix itself. Mastering may increase the perception of width, and yes some MEs do use stereo enhancers. You have to be very careful with this type of processing though as it can introduce a mess of problems (phase, mix imbalances, etc.). I usually don't recommend it unless you have absolute faith that your monitoring environment was nailing the reproduction of the stereo image, and even then....subtle subtle, especially if vinyl is going to be involved at some point."
4632,"Yeah... massive emo thread coming up! I have played drums for like 8 years now with the first few years being very chilled and laid back so it wasn't exactly rewarding, and the last 1,5 years have been pretty much the same. Somewhere in the middle there, I used to practise a lot and I had dreams of becoming some extreme death metal drummer... well fuck all that, those days are over now. Now I'm all about writing some good tunes and shit yo, right? But the fact remains: I SUCK at double kick drumming. Here is the deal: My right foot sucks more than my left foot for controlled/sustained battering of the kicks. It feels like I have zero control in my right foot when I want to play kick patterns that contain more than 2-3 subsequent notes on the right foot. This problem begins at around 170 BPM, so if I try to play 16th notes at 170 on my kicks, my right foot stutters and just completely locks up. I think it is psychological... I'm somehow blocking my muscles from performing, but it has been that way for yeeeears and I can't get rid of it. Do you know what I'm talking about? Got anything useful to tell me? I'm going nuts here... I'm not improving the slightest, and I can't even play my own songs and here I am trying to record my next project... what the FUCK. Cheers."
4727,"I am currently using Mackie HR624's for monitoring / mixing. I really like the way they sound, and my mixes are starting to translate relatively well to other audio systems. My question is - do you guys think it would make a big difference if I picked up a subwoofer and started mixing / monitoring on a 2.1 system? Let me know what you think, or what you are currently set up for in terms of your own studio monitoring. Thanks, Bobby"
994,"Hey, first time poster here... Had been looking around the forum for quite some time decided it was time to join! **Edit: Oops, think I might have posted this in the wrong sub-forum... sorry. Probably should have been under Production tips...*** Advance apology for the long post... sorry, I just want to be as detailed in my description as possible... Anyway, I'm mixing drums for my good friend's band and I'm having some issues. The sound they are aiming for is similar to The Red Chord, Carnifex, etc - modern death/progressive metal. I'm recording in a finished basement - wood floors, carpet under the drums, drop ceiling (about 7'6"" high), and I've controlled most reflections around the room with Audimute acoustic blankets and some rockwool acoustic panels. Not the best sounding room, but it's fairly dry and free of reflections. I'm doing my best to do without drum replacement. I really want to try my best to stay away from sampling the snare. The kick is the only thing I'm sampling, as I had tracked the drums with a mic and a trigger track and I like how it's sounding. I'm using samples of the actual kick from the kit. I recorded with a spaced pair overheads (audix adx51's), a mono room mic (akg c2000b), beta 57 snare top, i5 bottom, 57 hi hat mic and akg c1000s ride, audix i5/d2/d4 on toms, and d6 on kick. I've done my best to get phasing between mics all aligned. My mic placements were all textbook and proper. The snare and overheads are probably my biggest issues right now. The problem comes in when I am working with the snare sound. I tuned these drums meticulously - a big pearl vinnie paul sig snare - medium-tight tension - sounds REAL fat and big. I have a pretty good amount of hi hat and other drum bleed in the top snare, even though I used a hypercardiod mic and positioned it as best as I could out of the pickup zone of the hi hat. When I gate/expand the snare, I can get fairly pleasing results - not too choppy, but enough to tame the bleed and leave the sustain of the drum. Occasionally some hi hat and cymbals peek through when they're in unison with the snare, but there's nothing that can really be done about that. When I compress the snare (quite highly, as I need the consistent dynamics for an unsampled snare), I get really unpleasant bleed coming through the gate. It pops through and the only way to get rid of it is to have such a fast closing gate that I lose all tone from the drum and am left with just the transient attack. Plus, using the Dominion transient shaping plugin, I tend to add so much attack that I lose all the body of the drum. Adding any more sustain brings out more bleed. Also, when I go to add some sparkle and clarity to the snare and overheads (eq, harmonic enhancers, etc), it becomes a muddy mess. I'll side chain the snare to the overheads, but it compresses the overheads around the snare hits too much and leaves everything sounding muddy and undefined. I'll use a reference track just so I don't get lost within my own mix, but I can't get anywhere even close to the sparkle and shine of most recordings. Nothing fits together and it's frustrating the hell out of me! I'm gonna do my best to get my best mix down uploaded to here soon, possibly tomorrow, so that it's easier to hear what I'm dealing with. These modern, fat, huge drum sounds seem so unachievable. Something like the sound from The Contortionist () would be amazing... As far as I can tell, the snare seems almost 100% natural. I love this drum sound. I realize that my sound will be individual and replicating a sound is not realistic and not exactly desirable. But I like to base sounds off of something to begin with. Any response would be amazing. I've read through many posts here and I feel like it would be great to get some customized feedback, and not just re-reading the sticky post of the drum recording guide... Thanks!"

3842,"Before this year I never really watched this (past the auditions that is), but I'm really enjoying it now. Some of the performers are just insanely good, but I really like listening to the advice the guests give.. very similar to what most of us here are trying to do when tracking vocals, and some of the techniques and ideas they have are just fantastic, and you can really hear how the influence the end result. But, the Australian public can be pretty fucking retarded too. They voted off this chick, who even after only 2 performances (which were both pitchy, but despite that), may be my favourite female vocalist ever. http://www.australianidol.com.au/vi...0&vxTemplate=AustralianIdol09_IndexPlayer.swf I guess this is kinda off-topic, but the producer-side of it is definitely not. If nothing else, I strongly urge any of you to watch it just to hear what the guests have to say. A lot of it is bullshit, but they had Liza Minelli (who is an awful singer I have to say) on tonight, and goddamn if she didn't bring out the best possible performances in some of them. Her producing techniques are insane and I can only hope to try and apply them when I track vocalists."
1244,"Hey, I was fed up with testing amps etc to programmed drums, so I asked Pete of Alestorm to give me a little jam.... It's nothing spectacular, skins were old (end of session), and it was just an improvised jam, so not much stucture (no vers/chorus or so), it also is an improvised first take, so there are some stick.collision-clicks on some of the fills, other little flaws here and there etc (real drums, just replaced the kick with the kit's own sample), but overall I much perfer this to any programmed drums... unfortunately I don't have the time to come up with a guitar-/bass track for this, so I'd need someone to play some cool rhythm guitar and bass to this. What I need: -2 tracks of rh guits -TIGHT playing -new strings -high quality guitar (!) -high quality DI/recording chain -EMG pickups -down tuning preferred -Palmmutes tight, palm mutes loose (whooom), ringing powerchords, 1-2 fast singlestring licks...well, essentially I'll need a track that shows the different high gain rhythm qualities of amps. -you have to be a good player with good gear! and I'll also need the bassguitar (same criteria, except for the pickups, bartollini etc would be fine, too) so if anyone wants to do both=awesome, if you can do the guitar only it'd be cool if you could write down the tabs so someone else can play bass. the jam is 1:50 long at 170BPM I want to use these for official amp clips etc, so no copyright protected riffs etc of course. in return I'd of course give the drum jam to the forum (as well as the DIs) so that everyone here can use it for comparisons...I think it's time that we replace those overused testclips that have all either programmed drums, or subpar quality DIs or copirighted songs etc.... if you're up for it just reply with your gear and what you wanna play (bass, guitar, both)"

3106,"Hey guys this is my first post. I've been observing the ultimate metal forums for quite a while now.. Some of you guys are gods and I just can't thank all of you enough.. All the free software amps that have been coming out.. HOLY S@%!!!!! Ive been playing guitar for 16 years now. I play in a band that has 6505+ and a 5150 on rythym and the sound you get from these free software amps is so ridiculously close... 8505, that 5150 sounding one are like Deja-Vu. and without a doubt that v30 thing.. That thing is my go-to for chuggy rythym tracks, only question is which impulse.. I dl'd one from somewhere around here.. Really similar to my lead players 4x12 Mesa (1600$) sound but a bit less throaty which I prefer (Less eq = less headaches) (also free).. I honestly run my line 6 pod xt live (500 bucks when I bought it) into my computer in complete bypass mode and use the software I found on this site (free.. ) Also just the information in the stickys made my band sound better over the course of a week.. I really appreciate your guys effort. Anyway. More to the point. Ive been a vocalist for 6-7 years, and I was lucky enough about 4-5 years ago to stumble upon a Urel LA-4 (sexy black death box) and I went thru a differant couple mic preamps thru the years.. Turns out I kinda like cheaper ones. I dont completely squish my vox or distort them.. Just a lil drive, little cut.. In love with that sound.. Its been my sound.. Plus makes the highs in pigsqeels screeee-eee-eee-eam.. So my LA-4 got jacked.. Its gone.. and I have alot of things to spend 700+ dollars on before a new one.. Is there any software compressor/limiters that are similar.. I miss my sound.. dbx is poop. Also any pro tips on mic pres/compressors/anything whatsoever = Also.. If anyone who writes these beautiful guitar amp software is out there listening and isn't too busy writing these brilliant programs for the greater good of music and GUITARISTS everywhere.. Us VOCALISTS need a free plug too! Something that emulates a good metal voiced compressor/limiter and possibly a usable vocal drive/distort.. I was in love with my LA-4 sound.. Thatd be something good to emulate.. Not even sure what top of the line pre amps are.. Expecially for maxing/od. I relied on my LA-4 and the fact that I wasnt doing much to the signal besides leveling and givin some presence.. I am quite fancy with photoshop. And if a good programmer were to do such a feat. I would make the gui graphics for it and put up the webpage for it too and also worship the ground you walk.. tl;dr? :zombie:"

896,"I just recently was thinking what the word 'cut' in relation to EQ meant and what it actually does. When we say a EQ 'boost' it implies a volume increase of something audible, then when we say 'cut' it should mean remove the cut frequencies. So I opened up the built in EQ in cubase 5 and cut the entire frequency spectrum to max but I could still hear the exact same signal as before applying that extreme EQ (it was just softer) so when we say 'cut' a frequency, are we actually just lowering the volume of it, oppose to removing it entirely?"

To avoid standing waves, horrible reflections etc what would you recommend in the way of ghetto temporary treatment -- bearing in mind I'm only using the room for a few days and can't do any nailing etc. At the moment all I can think of is to move furniture at non-parallel angles and hang some duvets over walls and stacked furniture to try and kill some of the reflections. I'll place the drumkit tomorrow when I can actually hear where's best, but do you guys have any advice?"

3509,"A good idea that popped up in another thread. Killed a few hours. -Get it Here- Some History on the Original: The original 1963 recording of the Doctor Who theme music is widely regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesizers. Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop used musique concrete techniques to realize a score written by composer Ron Grainer. Each and every note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators which were used for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. The swooping melody and pulsating bass rhythm was created by manually adjusting the pitch of oscillator banks to a carefully-timed pattern. The rhythmic hissing sounds, ""bubbles"" and ""clouds"", were created by cutting tape recordings of filtered white noise. -Read More- Happy New Year."

3428,"So here lies the problem... About 2 days ago my computer would not play stuff in cubase so i thought it must be a driver problem , lo and behold it was so i got the beta version of Asio4All2 and it worked fine and dandy like summers candy. However I havent tried recording anything yet (just listeningback) so when i went to record today everything clocks up fine (tthe mixers LED is showing the levels coming through) but then when it gets to cubase there is no sign of any audio coming through??? So i went to play it back just in the chance that audio might've been captured just not displayed but there was still no audio. Long question over Short version : how do i get my DAW to pickup the sound?"
2052,"TL;DR Warning... So over the holiday weekend, I have been reformatting and reinstalling everything on my computer. I mentioned a few months ago that I had been experiencing lagginess and errors in both Pro Tools and Logic so I decided to trim all the fat and get down to business. I have a project starting Monday the 27th, so I figured I'd give myself a few days so I wasn't just staring at my computer hour after hour. I started with removing my old system drive and installing a new 1TB drive in two partitions. The first partition was for my OS, Logic and PT9, nothing else. The other partition was where I would put all my plugins. After days of installing each SDX and EZX I finally got ready to boot everything up and Digi Core Audio driver wasn't working. Looked online and I had updated too far beyond support of their 8.0.3 driver. Thankfully, I knew I could backtrack to the first version of Snow Leopard without wiping everything out, so I did. THEN 10.6.2 wouldn't install. I freaked out, reset my computer a half a dozen times, and no luck, it just wouldn't budge. So, reluctantly, I did a fresh install, wiping out days of work and starting back at 10.6.0. Again I tried 10.6.2, no luck. FUCKKKKKKKK!!!!!! Now if you have a brain that functions better than my own, you'll point out that it would be worth trying to go linearly and use the 10.6.1 update and see if that would work. However, in my sleep deprived, bah humbug driven angst I was unable to think so clearly and have thus wasted hours upon hours of my life. Sorry for the long pointless rant, but I guess it serves a purpose to say. ""Always look for the next logical step"" I've just finished installing the Superior and Avatar, my Logic installation is much more limited and I don't have the plethora of drum samples that I thought I would have in a perfectly organized beautiful fashion, but at least I will be ready for my session tomorrow. Nothing will be held up, but boy do I wish I could've just slept or sat on the toilet with all the time I wasted. I now think I understand the ""FUUU"" phenomenon, because this shit blows."

I understand the guy has some serious problems with anxiety and wasn't deliberately trying to steal money, so from my perspective I'm prepared to turn over a new leaf and enjoy listening to his music. Let this be a lesson to all of you: if you use paypal for a transaction, stump up the fees and don't say it's a gift. If I'd done that I would have got my money straight back, like Marcus did recently."

1018,"Hi guys, since there have been quite a few people who have had their stuff mixed/mastered by guys from this board I'm looking forward to hear this song mixed by you guys. The band that recorded it needs it as a (local) Radio Single to promote some shows in fall. Due to time/money constraints and band members being sick/not being in the same city some compromises had to be made. So these may not be the best takes ever but who gets those anyway. Their style goes in the direction of Paramore and Evanescence. Soundwise they are definitely looking for something in the vain of Paramore. So to everyone who wants to have a go at it: Here are the files for the song. http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1461588/Good Will Out/Paranoid/Paranoid.zip An info document is included. Please check it out before you start mixing. Creative input is welcome! If you think your skills as a producer can add to this track you are free to incorporate your ideas into the song. Please see the included info document about that as well. About Re-Amping: Real amps are great but certainly not a must. As long as it sounds good nobody cares if you used a Marshall practice amp, some VST Plug-In or anything else. Please post or PM me your mix along with the prize you ask for a 24 Bit / 44.1 kHz Stereo File of your mix. Once the best Mix has been chosen I'll be looking for someone to master it so make sure to stick around/come back here. Thanks guys."

3337,"I'm starting this post with a biiiiiiig looooong drawn out sigh. I'm so tired. Exhausted really. I've been tracking vox for ""that"" black metal dude's project today and once that was done and he went home, I started tracking drums for my album instead. Well actually I had started a bit yesterday so with today's progress I have tracked about 50% of the drums for the album. Here is the thing though. No matter how tight I play, I know I will still need to go in and edit pretty much every hit later anyway. I'm aiming for a really modern and ""produced"" mix and to get that I'll need to quantize the drums in generous amounts. This is pretty exhausting considering I'm both the ""studio tech guy"" AND the drummer... at the same time. SAME TIME. It's so frustrating and exhausting. It's actually so tiresome, it made me wonder why I'm still a drummer. Or considering myself a drummer at least. In 2009 I started to notice that my musical strength was shifting away from drums and shifting more into song writing. Or well, it wasn't really shifting AWAY from the drums but rather my song writing skills were growing up on par with my drumming, and exceeding it (by now). I seem to have gotten much better at guitar now as well considering people are commenting on my tightness and stuff rather often (not to brag, but I really appreciate it!). This really makes me wonder why I still keep a drumkit and go through all this hassle... I don't even know if the end result will be better than if I had just bought a good drum sample library and programmed the damn thing. My drumming is probably not gonna sound as good sound quality-wise as opposed to programmed drums but it might sound ""good"" in other aspects such as the human feel and so on. Man, I don't know, I'm rather jealous at you all who just program drums and record some guitars and post the song online. For me to do that, I have to make scratch tracks and shit, then learn the song on not only guitar but drums too, then go set up the mics and stuff, then track it, then edit it, THEN I can mix it and post it online. It takes forever. It feels kind of scary to consider selling the drums and switching to guitar and song writing ""full time"" but it also seems more right at the moment. Music is more to me than just ""metal drumming"". I want to write kick ass songs and express feelings and tell stories. I can't really do that just by smacking away 32nd notes at 240 BPM (not that I can do it, but it used to be one of my main goals in music/drumming). Did anyone bother reading this far? If you did, I thank you for showing interest in my progress with the album I will of course stick with real drums since I have started on it and I hope I'm wrong about ""is it worth it?"" and all that shit. Maybe the end result will become so awesome that I'll remember why I'm still drumming. Time will tell... oh god I'm tired. I think I'll go to bed soon. What do you think? P.S remember the post I made once when I said I was considering quitting music altogether? Well gladly I have steered the course of my life into something that can cope better with work and music at the same time so that's not an issue anymore. This post is not a ""whine whine, I'm quitting music!"", it's actually the opposite. I'm thinking of my musical future and what would be best for me to do to take it even further. Sacrifices need to be made in order to turn it into something bigger and better. The thought of me playing guitar live though... haha, that's a funny one! Never done that."

This thread is to facilitate the development of some e-bands, and hopefully we'll all learn something about our trades from one another and put out some quality material. It will also give us a chance to drool over what gear we have. So, I'm going to post pretty much my resume; I'm going to include some recorded material, my gear, my capabilities and skill levels, my desires, my songwriting habits, and my contact information. I hope you'll do the same, because I'm pretty sure that Metal Blade and Century Media are waiting for us to get started on this stuff, guys.

I'm also cool with old-fashioned text file tabs and stuff, or with plain audio. But I find it easier to map everything out in something like TabIt and churn out a recording based on that. What I Want to Create: Metal with melody. I'm looking for more of the same of what VMOD was, but I will CERTAINLY play lighter or heavier, whatever is within my skill range. Just having some melody is what's important to me. I don't really want to do a noisy thing. Instruments - Gear, Ability, Willingness, etc Guitar -Intermediate/advanced. Mainly rhythm, some lead -Guitars: Schecter Hellraiser V8 8-string, Schecter Hellraiser C7 7-string, Jackson DR7 7-string, Gibson worn Flying V 6-string, and a particularly cheap Yamaha acoustic -Amps/cabs: Marshall JMP1 preamp, Marshall 9100 power amp, Marshall 1960A cab, Mesa Oversize 4x12 straight/slant cab, TONS of free amp sims, even more impulses/Nebula cabsims. Also have an Ibanez Tubescreamer and a MIJ Boss HM2. There are more but none that are important. -Cab microphones: 2 x Audix I5, Sennheiser E906, M-Audio Sputnik, Sennheiser MD421 Bass -Beginner-intermediate -I'm a guitarist with a bass.

2593,"Hello world! My band just finished mixing our second demo! The result is pretty balanced (although it sounds ""demo-ish"" and unpolished) We are currently trying to decide what to do with mastering. We made some attempts and although the result is louder, we can't make it ""sit"" well on most systems, so the question is: Should we keep on trying to master it ourselves? Or leave it to someone who knows what he's doing? The problem is that we DON'T have a clear picture of what a mastering engineer can do. We know that mastering, in general, can give life to a mix, and we have listened to various ""before/after"" reference mixes, but we are unsure about our own songs, is specific. We might like it and pay for it, or we might feel that we can do it ourselves. Correct me if i am wrong, but with this in mind, we simply CAN NOT contact a mastering engineer and tell him ""dude, master this sh*t for us, but, eventually, we might find out that we need NO mastering assistance!!"" Is it fair for the guy? Even if the guy offers free sample for a song, would it be ""cheating"" to contact him? Cheers, and thanx in advance"

4364,"Got my Fireface 400 today, along with my Auralex MoPads. HUGE improvement in sound! The better DA converters from the FF400 really make a difference in the high end and stereo imaging. This makes the biggest difference with cymbals and drums in general, but other things requiring detail are improved a lot. The mopads helped clear up the bass and midrange. It's like a whole new set of monitors. Anyway, I'm getting a LOT of pops and crackles with ASIO drivers. If I'm using a latency below 256 samples, it is completely unusable due to distortion. If I use a latency above 256 samples, no sound is made at all. If I use 256 samples, it works, but the pops and crackles are terrible. Using all the latest drivers and the appropriate firewire card ( TI, SIIG, 2 port 1394 ). Any idea whats wrong?"
